              <p class="text-bg-light fs-5">
                Strolling along a narrow path arounding temples and shrines, 
                you will feel the cool shade of trees. 
                Named after the philosopher Nishida Kitaro who had been contemplating here, 
                the path inspired many authors including Haruki Murakami.</p>

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                Although I'm walking on the Philosopher's, I was totally blacking out. I simply feel 
                the gentle breeze and the refreshing air. It is a place to relax both body and mind. 
                However, the small creatures along this trail sometimes catch my eyes.

              <h2 class="text-primary">Contented Cat</h2>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                On the pathway, there was a cat with orange and white fur, leisurely lounging on a wooden 
                chair, basking in the sun, and grooming itself. When our group approached, it unexpectedly 
                came down and affectionately interacted with us. It is sooooo adorable!
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                We followed it for a while and were pleasantly surprised to encounter another brown and white 
                cat. Not knowing their relationship, we eagerly anticipated what might happen next, and the 
                brown cat began gently grooming the orange cat. So cute!!!

                Before our trip to Kyoto, our family had just lost a member - our cat Little Tiger. 
                However, meeting these two cats on this path inexplicably healed our hearts.

                Along the path, there are also clear and transparent a little ditch on the side. 
                Waterbirds glide gently along the water's flow, experiencing the tranquility of the journey.

              <h2 class="text-primary">Graceful Fish</h2>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                Occasionally, within the small ditch, we would come across little plump fish, 
                swimming side by side or one in front of the other.

                The fish continue to move forward in the water, perhaps they are also searching for 
                their own philosophy of life.

              <hr>
              <p class="text-bg-light fs-5">
                The shrine on the Philosopher's Walk is renowned for its unique animal guardian 
                deities. In addition to the common guardian Komainu (a fantasic creature with 
                semi-dog semi-lion appearance) at shrines, this shrine includes guardian mice, 
                foxes, snakes, monkeys, and hawks. Among them, the guardian mice are said to be 
                one of a kind all over Japan.
              </p>
              <img class="rounded" src="../../images/shrine_1.jpg" height="auto" width="100%"/>
              <p></p>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                This attraction was originally not on the itinerary, but my brother had the ability 
                to sense the energies of the spiritual realm, and he felt that this shrine was 
                invitating to him. "You can pray for your sister's illness with me! Come take a look!" 
                With a sense of being called, we halted our journey along the Philosopher's Walk 
                temporily, climbed uphill, and embarked on an exploratory visit.
              </p>
              <img class="rounded" src="../../images/shrine_2.JPG" height="auto" width="100%"/>

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                At the entrance to the shrine, there was a charming illustration 
                depicting the guardian animal deities within the shrine, providing an introduction to them.

              <h2 class="text-primary">Guardian Snakes ahead of Main Hall</h2>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                The main hall is dedicated to the gods of medicine, Sukunahikonanomikoto, 
                the god of learning, Sugawara no Michizane, and the war god, Homutawake no mikoto. 
                In front of the main hall, there are two guardian serpent deities, one black and 
                one white. The guardian serpent is associated with healing, health, rejuvenation, 
                and financial prosperity. Since my Chinese Zodiac Sign is the Snake, this might be 
                why we are called to come and visit.

                At that time, I only had 1 coin of 500 yen and 2 coins of 100 yen, 
                just enough to offer to the main shrine's gods and the guardian gods.

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                The main shrine is dedicated to Susanoo-no-Mikoto. The two guardian mouse deities on either side 
                have different roles. The one on the right, holding a scroll, oversees interpersonal 
                relationships and academic achievements. The one on the left, holding a water vessel, 
                oversees interpersonal relationships, fertility, and safe childbirth.</p>

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                It is said that this shrine is the only one in all of Japan Shrine with mouse guardian deities, 
                and many visitors come here because of this unique feature.

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                Just like all the other Inari shrines, this gods here blesses a bountiful harvest, 
                with foxes as their guardian spirits.

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                If you want to pray for avoding disasters, you can visit the shrine on the left side. 
                Due to the belief in mountain gods at Mt. Hiei in Kyoto, it gradually evolved into 
                the image of a demon-slaying monkey, so when it comes to warding off calamities, 
                the guardian god would be the Saru (monkey)!

              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                If you particularly wish to pray for the prevention of fires, you can also go to the shrine 
                on the left side, where the guardian spirit of the mountains, hawks, is located.
              </p> 
              <h2 class="text-primary">Guardian Komainu at Entrance</h2>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                Because the shrine is filled with so many adorable guardian deities, 
                the common Komainu receive less attention. However, the Komainu located at 
                the entrance of the shrine play an important role in preventing evil spirits 
                from entering the shrine!

              <h1 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">Japanese Tea Ceremony</h1>
              <hr>
              <p class="text-bg-light fs-5">
                The Japanese tea ceremony emphasizes introspection and tranquility. 
                Participants in the tea ceremony use green tea powder to prepare matcha, 
                which is enjoyed together with traditional sweets later. 
                They engage in conversation, deepening their understanding and connection with each other.
              </p>
              <img class="rounded" src="../../images/tea_ceremony_2.JPG" height="auto" width="100%"/>
              <p></p>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                During our stay at the youth hostel this time, there happened to be an employee 
                who organized a matcha experience event with full English instruction. 
                Since the location for these activities changes each time, 
                it's a unique and serendipitous experience provided by that young lady.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-primary">Preparing Matcha</h2>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                First, the young lady provided my mother and me each with a tea bowl and a brush. 
                She taught us to first pour some hot water into the tea bowl to preheat it and 
                then pour it out. Next, we poured in hot water and added green tea powder, 
                stirring it evenly. Finally, the most skillful part was using the wrist's strength 
                flexibly, moving quickly between the tea mixture and the air above it, 
                creating a dense foam by incorporating air into the tea.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                While my mother, who bakes regularly, quickly grasped the technique, 
                I was so clumsy that the young lady couldn't bear to watch and had to step in to help me. (Tears)
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-primary">Tasting Yokan</h2>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                To help us fully immerse ourselves in the tea ceremony culture, 
                this event provided each person with a small red bean yokan. 
                The sweetness of the yokan paired perfectly with the bitterness of the matcha. 
                The young lady also taught us about the culture of turning the tea bowl, 
                but it was so intricate that I've now forgotten all of it.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-primary">Enjoying Interaction</h2>
              <img class="rounded" src="../../images/Nanzenji_05.jpg" height="auto" width="100%"/>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                While we were enjoying yokan and matcha, the young lady had a lot of conversation with us.
                She asked us about our daytime activities and our impressions of Japan. 
                I mentioned "Nanzen-ji" in Chinese, and because in Japanese it is a Chinese-derived reading, 
                the young lady immediately knew where I was talking about.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                She wasn't talking about the religious significance of Nanzen-ji 
                but the beauty of the waterworks inside. 
                Indeed, as shown in the photo above, the European-style waterworks is a famous 
                Instagram-worthy spot. I have a tendency to make quirky gestures at such Instagram-worthy 
                locations – it's just my style!
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 p_formatter">
                I told her that in Taiwan we often watch a Japanese TV show called 
                "A House in Remote Wilderness" (often only one house in a whole mountain), 
                and she quickly understood. It seems the unique characteristics of the show are quite 
                apparent. Also, we discussed whether we'd like to live in remote and secluded places. 
                Overall, it was a delightful evening about cross-cultural exchange.
